# Goal of this repo
learn by doing react; and html and markdown in the process of doing it.
- make some html elements, using their different documentation
- use markdown for documentation purposes
- use some math to introduce the functional programming paradigm
    - use physics as examples, big goal is the 4 Maxwel's acoplated equations
	## I want to use functional programming here in JS then in other project in Lisp + Emacs by Aug, 1st, 2020

In this talk, we’ll create an effective mental model of Concurrent React by building a tiny clone of React! We will start with a blank js file and learn about how React renders components, schedules Time-Slicing updates with a Work Loop, add Hooks, and end off with a mini-clone of Suspense!

Great #a11y lessons by @hellonehha:

- Not all disabilities are visible. Don't assume.
- Disabilities (including injuries) can be short/long term.
- Semantic markup is your friend.
- JS can enhance accessibility.

chat {
While I am a great fan of semantic HTML this point (of inbuilt accessibility in native elements) was a big eyeopener when I first heard it.
semantic markup
}

tab hell
	too many tabs
		-> only 1 to go to main content, e.g. amazon

single page app (spa)	
spa no refresh happening

screen reader and semantic markup





# talk sam julien from Auth0



chat {
it's Keynote for slides, slides look great

Bryce Dooley​is there a specific auth0 sdk you'd recommend for storing tokens client-side?
Sam Julien​@Bryce Dooley auth0-spa-js is the ticket here

Sam Julien​one addendum on this: some people find they also need to account for the "develop-html" stage as well, i.e. "if (["build-html", "develop-html"].includes(stage)) { }..."
}

maybe == it depends

# talk Andrey Goncharov with ""Lifting state up is killing your app""

only tested the sunny day scenario, b/c that is what a demo should be able todo. that is a demo

virtual dom is cheap but not free,
reconciliation

chat {
xtremecarprox​@LIGIL VJ For example, parsing a massive data set and storing it into a hash table data structure. Allows for SUPER fast access to needed data.
Claudia Podol​@LIGIL VJ, check memoization. @Andrey Goncharov showed us an example in React to manage performance.
}

### introducing so not get fired, woosh!
# nothing in life is at no cost, or free (as in FreeDom)
# we'll code for food (money wont hurt) other "things" as well
# (10)^2 is a demo -> (130)^2 is mindBlown!
# performance&profilling!!!
# Do Not do it (swoosh! loGo)
# ThankYou Kudos!

# talk ​@Claudia Bressi
chat {
Francisco Treviño​@Claudia Bressi why the preference use external state manager?, separation of concerns?
Claudia Bressi​@Francisco Treviño separation of concerns first of all but also with mobx you can reuse state and this is great for specific project where you share business logic

# tl;dr lambda/functional programming
# to stress the overwhelming influence of the λ-calculus among all other models of computation:
- It codifies not only computation, but also the basic principles of
 human reason (natural deduction).
- Moreover, it was born fully formed, and is directly and
 immediately relevant to this day, rather than something that
 collects dust on the shelf.

# one of the greatest achievements of the human mind, the concept
of a variable (= reasoning under hypotheses)html
